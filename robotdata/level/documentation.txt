so since you're reading this, you might know what this is.
but also maybe not so here is what this is:
this is documention, which is basically how the inner workings work
and that's it
but how about the actual documentation?

RGBA is needed for a stage, and here is what each of them mean:
R means what the thing is.  it says what it should do and is the "item id" of this
G means how many hits the thing can take before it spontaneously detonates.  robot is uneffected by this value, sorry
B is extra data.  this value changes with every object, provided they use it.
A means what it looks like.  this can't be zero, and if it is the object in question will be ignored completely.

how about the R to thing chart?

robot is 1 (B is background colour)
kitty is 2
ground is 3 (B sets if it's explosive, 1 for yes, 2 for indirectly)
(baba is you)
squiddle is 4
murp is 5
drippy is 6
zarp is 7 (B sets fire interveal in 1/30th of a second)
slurg is 8
key is 9 (A also sets key type, unless B isn't 0)
gate is 10 (A also sets gate type, unless B isn't 0)
upgrade is 11 (B sets upgrade type, see upgrade info section far below)

what upgrades are there?
